# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Inventory Tracker is a simple application that can be used by businesses to keep track of various items in their inventory. Once low on stock, the application should send a reminder to the company to purchase additional stocks. Furthermore, users can add/update/delete the items in the inventory to more accurately represent what the company currently has. Lastly, the application can keep track of the user who last edited the items, and should be able to produce a log of changes when needed.

The Inventory Tracker application can be branched off and be used when creating trading websites, with automatic handlers to keep the application hands free in terms of updating incoming/outgoing stocks. The web application should feature a dynamic look to automatically update information as they change.
### Features
The Inventory Tracker will have the following features:
 - User Login: Users will have to login to make changes to the inventory, and to be able to keep track on who last edited what item.
 - Search: Users will be able to search for certain texts and/or part number from the items in the inventory to allow them to easily maneuver through the entire inventory
 - Create: Users will be able to add new items into the inventory.
 - Update: Users will be able to update existing items when new stock has arrived.
 - Delete: Users will be able to delete items from the inventory when the stocks runs out.
 - Change Tracker: Users will be able to view who was the last one who created/updated/deleted the items. This will either be shown on the product tracker itself, or it can also be shown as a log.
 - Low Stock Reminder: The app should be able to notify the users (probably of higher level) when an item in the inventory is currently running low on stock.
